# Separating functionality into different binaries

A project's code and it's behaviour are inextricably linked. 

The aim of this reordering is putting things in the right places 
and hopefully set myself up for better encapsulation.

This was the right step given the **explosion** of functionality 
since the project began and all the ideas that have come up since then.

Next up is keep figuring out how to manage this growing code-base
while keeping it as simple and organized as possible (always a challenge).
